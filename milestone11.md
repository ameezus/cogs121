Khaled Ahmad:
I've helped with figuring out how to structure the data in order to display in the visualizations. helped with thinking of how to pivot our idea into more of a Facebook visualization application rather than purely a travel application. We started to implemenet the facebook login, so that we can get the data. Also helped with some design / css things.

Shreeman Hariharan: Since Milestone 9, I helped my team come up with the elevator pitch and I worked on making the navbar on the app. 
This navbar replaced the old button system that allowed for toggling between displays as this new navbar has every display and page 
accessible through it.

This UI feature is the navigation bar that allows the user to access the different features of the app more easily than before. This
is an improvement from the previous milestone submission as there are no more buttons in an overlay container in the middle of the 
screen as this used to hide some of the map and graph features. The navbar now highlights what feature the user is currently viewing 
for reference.
