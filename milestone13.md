Belal Aboabdo: 

Ameer Muhtaseb: Worked on making nicer legends for some of the visualizations, cleaned up some older code and helped test
the new facebook integration.

Khaled Ahmad: 


This is a new visualization that we added. It's a bar graph that allows users to see how much they traveled in a given 
month, where they traveled in that month, and how much time they spent in that specific place. The different places traveled
to in the same month are differentiated by different colored blocks within the same bar.

This is the login page we added so that users can connect their facebook accounts to our app so that we can pull their
facebook data and use it to populate our heatmap and other visualizations with their facebook checkins.
