Shreeman Hariharan:

Belal Aboabdo: Implemented a new Bar Graph that displays the duration of time you spend traveling in each country in a given month. Generated fake data for now to dispolay the information. Also looked into getting location data from other social networks like Google and Instagram.

Ameer Muhtaseb: Worked on making nicer legends for some of the visualizations, cleaned up some older code and helped test
the new facebook integration.

Khaled Ahmad: 


This is a new visualization that we added. It's a bar graph that allows users to see how much they traveled in a given 
month, where they traveled in that month, and how much time they spent in that specific place. The different places traveled
to in the same month are differentiated by different colored blocks within the same bar.
