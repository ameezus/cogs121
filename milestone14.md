Shreeman Hariharan: I worked on the navigation panel by making vertical and adding the feature where the legend for the 
graph is shown in response to hovering the mouse over the link. I also made this navbar more informative by adding small
thumbnail images next to the link text for reference.

App Features:
- This app simply allows users to visualize through a heatmap and graphs where they have travelled to. In order to avoid the
issue with manual insertion of locations, the application fetches location check-in data from the users' Facebook profiles.

- The app allows users to login via Facebook and import locations where they checked-in via Facebook in order to be displayed
on graphs and a heatmap by the application.

- The app contains different graphical representations for users to be able to visualize their travel data. These representations 
include a heatmap (made with Google Maps), bubble graph, circle graph, line graph, and a bar graph. All of these graphs 
except for the heatmap are created using Vega.

- The app contains a navbar (image below) that allows users to navigate through the website. Hovering the mouse over each link 
label allows the user to see a description/legend of each graph/map representation. The user can randomly choose a graph to be 
displayed.
