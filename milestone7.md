Shreeman Hariharan: Worked on making the heatmap display the location points in a more visible fashion and display the map itself
in a more clear way such that the map colors do not interfere with the heatmap layer colors. Added more fake data to make the 
heatmap feature more apparent. Worked on adding a navbar that could be used later for client-side features such as adding locations,
deleting locations, exiting the map etc.

This functionality below is the heatmap feature that allows the user to view where they have travelled to on a map. The more colors there
are in a circle on the heatmap, the more places in that region the user has been to. In terms of improvement from the previous 
version of the map, this new map has a neutral map layer coloring of landscape and water as the map colors previously interfered with 
the heatmap layering that displayed the locations travelled to. In addition, the radius of the travel points is larger than the one
from last time, allowing for greater visibility of where the user has travelled to. A toggle feature has been added to the heatmap so that the user can switch to other forms of visualizations of where they have travelled, such as graphs and charts.
