Shreeman Hariharan: Worked on making the heatmap display the location points in a more visible fashion and display the map itself
in a more clear way such that the map colors do not interfere with the heatmap layer colors. Added more fake data to make the 
heatmap feature more apparent. Worked on adding a navbar that could be used later for client-side features such as adding locations,
deleting locations, exiting the map etc.
