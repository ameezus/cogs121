Shreeman Hariharan: Since turning in Milestone 7, I worked on the paper prototype for the "Import From Facebook" screen. After that,
I worked on the data input screen's front-end that allows users to import their data from Facebook or input their data manually.

This functionality is another graphical representation of the data that shows the locations that have been travelled to with
links between the starting and ending locations for trips. The locations with longer arc lengths are ones that have been travelled
to more often as there are more links associated with them. This functionality is an improvement since Milestone 7 because it
now shows the starting and ending locations for each trip that has been taken, which allows the user to track more information
regarding their data.
