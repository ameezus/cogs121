Classmates' Feedback: Overall, our peer reviewers said that we should move away from ideas that deal with the UCSD campus being mapped out since such ideas have already been implemented. Although one of our reviewers said that they do not fully understand the concept of our travel tracking idea yet, we felt that this idea is unique and will be understandable to the user as we add cool and easy-to-use features.

Proposed Features: 

Splitting the Work: Teammate #1 will work on the front-end views and interactions, Teammate #2 will work on the server-side, and Teammate #3 and Teammate #4 will work on the map functionality setup and any other front-end/back-end issues dealing with the map.
